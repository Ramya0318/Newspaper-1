        <p> Almost 12,000 of the cases reported nationwide on Saturday were labelled asymptomatic. 

            Vice Premier Sun Chunlan arrived in the country's virus hotspot of Shanghai to oversee prevention efforts, as she ordered officials to curtail the outbreak "as soon as possible," according to Xinhua. Cases in the financial hub exceeded 8,000 on Saturday including 7,788 asymptomatic infections. Shanghai will start a new round of mass testing on Monday, authorities said.Sun, who previously went to Jilin to oversee lockdown measures in the northeast province, ordered Shanghai officials to "resolutely" conduct measures to stop the outbreak. All of the metropolis' 25 million residents are currently under some form of quarantine.In the city of Sanya in Hainan province, authorities suspended all transportation to stymie the spread of Covid. </p>

    <div id="col1">China added more than 13,000 new Covid-19 infections with state media reporting a case infected with a new subtype of the omicron variant.
        The new iteration of the virus, isolated from a mild Covid-19 patient in a city less than 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Shanghai, evolves from the BA.1.1 branch of the omicron variant, Global Times reported, citing sequencing data from local health authorities.  

    </div>
    <div id="col2">The report said the subtype doesn't match other coronavirus that's causing Covid in China nor those submitted to GISAID, where scientists around the world share the coronavirus they sequenced as a way to monitor mutations.

        A case in Dalian city in northern China reported on Friday also didn't match any coronavirus found domestically, the municipal government said on its WeChat account.

        <p>Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has built a 9.2% stake in Twitter Inc, a regulatory filing showed on Monday, sending the micro-blogging site's shares soaring 16% in premarket trading.
            Late March, the silicon valley billionaire said he was giving "serious thought" to building a new social media platform.
            
            Musk was responding to a Twitter user's question on whether he would consider building a social media platform consisting of an open source algorithm.</p>

        <p>The decentralisation of the government has been among the top-billed priorities of the YSR Congress government which had announced the creation of village secretariats as well.

            Mr Reddy, while campaigning for the 2019 assembly elections, had promised that his party, if voted to power, would make each of the 25 Lok Sabha constituencies a district.Each of the districts is now the same as the parliamentary constituencies except Araku that is going to be split into two districts as the Chief Minister reportedly wants a higher focus on the backward tribal areas.

    <div id="col5"><p>Hyderabad: Andhra Pradesh got a new administrative map on Monday, with the creation of 13 new districts that doubled their number to 26, in a massive overhaul that the state government said will improve governance and delivery of services.
        Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy launched the new districts at a virtual ceremony in the morning, following an "auspicious muhurat" time set by Vedic priests.
        
        The creation of more districts is meant to be a step in the decentralised development of all regions, he said.</p></div>
